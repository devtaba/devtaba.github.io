              Hi, I'm Abigail! I recently graduated
              from the University of Washington, Seattle
              with my B.S. in Computer Science!
            </h1>

              I'm interested in full-stack
              software development,
              user-friendly design,
              and machine learning. During my undergrad, I interned
              at companies including <b>Uber</b>, <b>Salesforce</b>,
              <b>iRobot</b>, and <b>Nielsen</b>.

              Currently, I am searching for new grad software engineer
              roles!

                <p>I interned at the Port of Seattle the summers of
                  2018 and 2019. There, I worked on solving problems
                  at the SeaTac International Airport with machine learning.
                  Most notably, I helped build a solution for detection of
                  large luggage on airport escalators to aid in mitigating
                  the rise in airport escalator accidents. Using this detection model,
                  I was also able to provide an analysis of indoor traffic patterns at
                  the airport. This solution was also featured in the

                books they've read, want to read, and are currently reading, 
                as well as keep up with friends. Overall, the goal of this app
                is to create a modern social media for readers and incentivize
                reading in today's era. You can check it out on GitHub

                The project uses <strong>React.js</strong> on the frontend
                and <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>,
                and, <strong>Firebase</strong> on the frontend. I also prototyped the
                design on <strong>Figma</strong>. Testing was done using <strong>Jest</strong>
                and <strong>React Testing Library</strong>.

                Through University of Washington's Digital and Experimental Art department,
                I helped perform research on creative art generation through the use of GANs.
                In particular, the focus of the research was on developing ML tools that
                make the use of new machine learning models more accessible to nontechnical communities,
                specifically creative communities. You can read my research report

                The frontend is built in <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>
                and the backend uses a custom Graph data structure built in <strong>Java</strong>

                and security deposits.
