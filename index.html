                Hi, I'm Abigail! I'm a senior
                studying computer science
                at the University of Washington.

                I'm interested in full-stack
                software development,
                user-friendly design,
                and machine learning.

                <p>I interned at the Port of Seattle the summers of
                  2018 and 2019. There, I worked on solving problems
                  at the SeaTac International Airport with machine learning.
                  Most notably, I helped build a solution for detection of
                  large luggage on airport escalators to aid in mitigating
                  the rise in airport escalator accidents. Using this detection model,
                  I was also able to provide an analysis of indoor traffic patterns at
                  the airport. This solution was also featured in the

                Librocast is a full-stack web application that allows users 
                to create a profile where they can keep track of reading goals, 
                books they've read, want to read, and are currently reading, 
                as well as keep up with friends. Overall, the goal of this app
                is to create a modern social media for readers and incentivize
                reading in today's era. You can check it out on GitHub

                The project uses <strong>React.js</strong> on the frontend
                and <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>,
                and, <strong>Firebase</strong> on the frontend. I also prototyped the
                design on <strong>Figma</strong>. Testing was done using <strong>Jest</strong>
                and <strong>React Testing Library</strong>.

                Through University of Washington's Digital and Experimental Art department,
                I helped perform research on creative art generation through the use of GANs.
                In particular, the focus of the research was on developing ML tools that
                make the use of new machine learning models more accessible to nontechnical communities,
                specifically creative communities. You can read my research report

                The frontend is built in <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>React.js</strong>

                Inspired by my younger brother's passion for cutting hair, I built

                and security deposits.

                The frontend uses <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>MaterialUI</strong>.
